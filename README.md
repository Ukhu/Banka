# Banka

Banka is a light-weight core banking application that powers banking
operations like account creation, customer deposit and withdrawals.

This app is meant to support a single bank, where users can signup and
create bank accounts online, but must visit the branch to withdraw or
deposit money.

This project is part of my Andela Developer Challenge.
